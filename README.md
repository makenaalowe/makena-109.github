    <h2>Q1 Watch the video. What strikes you most about this history? </h2>
    <p> I think what was the most interesting about the history of the 
        internet is seeing how far the internet has evolved.
        For example, how the internet can adapt to 
        the different parts of society, and evolve into new 
        technology like AI and it shapes the way that people 
        communicate and adaptive society. Back then, seeing how the 
        internet is just used for the military communication and education 
        to other fields such as healthcare, entertainment and finance 
        really benifited. The internet grew popular from that impacts 
        every aspect of life. Even though the new technology still 
        needs to improve, on different aspects like missinformation, especiallyon different things 
        such as AI created articles and chatbots.Evolving technology brings in 
        new challenges that impact our experiences of using the internet. </p>

     <h2>Q2 What happens if you add href=”#id-name” to an anchor tag? (assuming you replace id-name with an id of an actual element on your page)</h2>
    <p> If I added href = "id-name" to the anchor tag it will create a link to click that scrolls down the element that has a corresponding "id".  </div></p>

    <h2>Q3 What is the difference between the following relative links: src = “images/phone.png” src = “/images/phone.png”? </h2>
     <p> src="images/phone.png path is relative to the location of the HTML file. 
        The browser looks for the images folder in the same directory as the HTML file.
        src = "/images/phone.png path starts from the root directory of your website. 
        The browser looks for the images folder at the root level of your site, 
        regardless of where the HTML file is. The main differences are the location 
        file is based on where the html file is located in relation to where the
        images directory.  </p>

     <h2>Q4 What happens if you add aria-hidden=”true” to an HTML element?</h2>
     <p> What happens is is that the element is present in the code however it is hidden
        in the website in things like screen readers and screen reading technology 
        making it harder for accessability people to read and harder to used.
